# Big Data Specialization - Coursera #
Repo for the "Big Data" specialization of Coursera -- **By University of California, San Diego and Splunk as partner** --

About the specialization : 

> Drive better business decisions with an overview of how big data is organized, analyzed, and interpreted. Apply your insights to real-world problems and questions.
> 
> 
> Do you need to understand big data and how it will impact your business? This Specialization is for you. You will gain an understanding of what insights big data can provide through hands-on experience with the tools and systems used by big data scientists and engineers. Previous programming experience is not required! You will be guided through the basics of using Hadoop with MapReduce, Spark, Pig and Hive. By following along with provided code, you will experience how one can perform predictive modeling and leverage graph analytics to model problems. This specialization will prepare you to ask the right questions about data, communicate effectively with data scientists, and do basic exploration of large, complex datasets. In the final Capstone Project, developed in partnership with data software company Splunk, youâ€™ll apply the skills you learned to do basic analyses of big data.



The specialization is divided into several courses:

1. Introduction to Big Data
2. Big Data Modeling and Management Systems
3. Big Data Integration and Processing
4. Machine Learning with Big Data
5. Graph analytics for Big Data
6. Big Data - Capstone Project

For the hands-on exercices in this repo, I used : 

- Cloudera as distribution on VirtualBox
- KNIME, Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark as analyzing frameworks and some Spark's libraries, such as PySpark, SparkSQL, GraphX or SparkStreaming
- Python, Scala as programming languages
- Neo4j as graph database platform
- Postgres and MongoDB as databases
- and a lot of other tools : Splunk, spark-shell, Jupyter Notebook, GraphStream library, etc.
